              'Marinating the Chicken:\n\n'
              '1. Prepare the chicken by cleaning and washing the chicken pieces thoroughly. Drain excess water.\n'
              '2. In a bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Add chicken pieces to this mixture. Coat the chicken pieces well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (preferably longer for better flavors).\n\n'
              'Cooking Rice:\n\n'
              '1. Rinse basmati rice thoroughly under running water until the water runs clear. Soak rice in water for 30 minutes.\n'
              '2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add salt, bay leaf, green cardamom pods, cloves, and cinnamon stick. Add drained rice. Cook rice until it is 70-80% done. Drain the water and keep aside.\n\n'
              'Cooking Biryani Masala:\n\n'
              '1. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or pot.\n'
              '2. Add sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown.\n'
              '3. Add chopped tomatoes and slit green chilies. Cook until tomatoes are softened and oil starts to separate.\n\n'
              'Layering the Biryani:\n\n'
              '1. Spread half of the marinated chicken evenly over the masala.\n'
              '2. Spread half of the cooked rice over the chicken layer.\n'
              '3. Sprinkle chopped fresh coriander leaves, mint leaves, fried onions, and a few saffron strands soaked in milk.\n'
              '4. Repeat the layers with the remaining chicken and rice.\n'
              '5. Optionally, dot the top layer with ghee for added flavor.\n\n'
              'Dum Cooking (Slow Cooking):\n\n'
              '1. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can also seal the edges with dough or aluminum foil to trap steam.\n'
              '2. Cook biryani on low heat (dum) for about 20-25 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the chicken to cook thoroughly.\n'
              '3. Turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10-15 minutes before opening the lid.\n\n'
